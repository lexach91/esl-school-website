              <h3>Who are we?</h3>
              <p>
                Starlight English has been established in 2015 by a group of
                enthusiastic teachers. It started as a small ESL training
                center, and grew into a competitive private school with our own
                kindergarten, language learning center, and art class. We live
                to teach, to learn, and to make our students smarter, happier,
                and more creative.

              <h3>Why choose us?</h3>
              <p>
                We really care about what we do. Every our student is is THE
                student, not A student. Our team of international level
                teachers, teacher assistants, and managers is there for you and
                your child all week, month, and year long. We aim to become the
                second family for all our students, support them in their
                journey to the world of knowledge and creativity

              <h3>Why now?</h3>
              <p>
                If not now, than when? Your child is special, and he should
                understand it, and feel it as soon as possible. Start the road
                to the life earlier - and the path will become easier every day.
