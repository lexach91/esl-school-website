              Here we have a waiting area for the parents and kids with
              comfortable seats, reading area, and a couple of play zones.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the main hall we are going to meet you and your child everyday
              when you bring him to kindergarten or afterschool classes.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are always going to feel welcome to sit here and relax, drink
              some coffee, or maybe even eat a snack while we are taking care of

              Let's take a look at a place where children spend most time of
              their day
            </h3>
            <p>Here is one of our classrooms.</p>
            <p>
              Positive and modern classroom environment is really important factor in student's learning. The children should feel safe and secure there.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's why our classrooms meet all international standards. We want our students feel comfortable all the time. 
            </p>
            <p>
              When children feel safe, secure, and comfortable, it becomes easier for them and for us to concentrate on learning, teaching, and having fun through all the day.

            <h3>The most delicious part of our tour</h3>
            <p>
              Research not once has shown the importance of healthy diet in children's life.
            </p>
            <p>
              It leads to a better memory, higher grades, and faster information processing. Well nourished kids get enough energy to stay focused through the day. 
            </p>
            <p>
              That's why we pay special attention to our ability to keep our students well and healthy fed. Our kitchen staff consists of professionals only.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, in our school your child will get not only required knowledge, but healthy and delicious meals as well.

            <h3>Here we give children a chance to be creative</h3>
            <p>
              Integrating art in the learning process is very rewarding. It helps young learners to open themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Art is pushing students to develop creativity, problem-solving skills, motor skills, social skills, and inventiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
              We help our students to boost their critical thinking, improve academic performance, and explore their interests through the art.
            </p>
            <p>
              Creating something new is always so exciting for the kids, we love to see them happy and satisfied with their own results.
